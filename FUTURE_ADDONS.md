# Future Addons for SuperSecure Password Manager

This document outlines a list of potential enhancements and features that could be added to improve functionality, usability, and security of the SuperSecure Password Manager in future versions.

## 1. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

- Require a second authentication factor (TOTP, hardware key) in addition to the master password.
- Local-only implementation using QR code-based TOTP generation.

## 2. Encrypted Notes / Secure Journal

- Allow users to store encrypted free-form notes for secure information not tied to passwords.

## 3. Tags and Categorization

- Enable tagging of password entries for filtering and grouping (e.g., "work", "banking", "personal").

## 4. Password History

- Maintain a history of old passwords for each entry.
- Allow restoration to a previous version if needed.

## 5. Vault Auto-Save Indicator

- Visual indicator or timestamp showing last successful vault save.
- Option to export a copy on each save for external backup.

## 6. Browser Extension Support

- Provide integration with Chrome and Firefox to autofill login forms.
- Local-first and isolated from any external sync services.

## 7. Secure File Attachments

- Attach small encrypted files (e.g., scanned IDs, keys) to entries.

## 8. Dark Mode

- Add support for a darker color theme for reduced eye strain.

## 9. Optional Password Sharing

- Encrypt and export a single password entry to share securely with another user (with password-protected decryption).

## 10. Data Integrity Verification

- Cryptographic integrity checks on vault data to detect tampering or corruption.

## 11. Mobile PWA Support

- Enable SuperSecure to be installed as a Progressive Web App with offline-first behavior and home screen shortcuts.

## 12. Customizable Timeout and Clipboard Clearing

- Let users set their own inactivity timeout and clipboard auto-clear delay.

## 13. Biometric Unlock (Browser-Supported)

- Leverage browser APIs (e.g., WebAuthn, Credential Management API) to allow fingerprint or face recognition unlock on supported devices.

## 14. Secure Destruction Mode

- Provide an option to securely erase all stored data beyond typical deletion (e.g., overwrite localStorage multiple times).

## 15. Localization / Multilingual Support

- Translate UI into multiple languages.
- Load translations dynamically based on browser language.
