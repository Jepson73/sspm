# SuperSecure Password Manager

SuperSecure is a standalone, browser-based password manager focused on privacy, offline access, and robust encryption. Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it requires no server or third-party dependencies. Everything is self-contained and runs locally in your web browser.

This project is intended for technically-inclined users who value minimalism, transparency, and control over their own data.

---

## Project Goals

- **Offline-first and client-only**: Your passwords never leave your machine.
- **Strong cryptography**: Uses AES-GCM and PBKDF2 from the WebCrypto API.
- **Full ownership**: Vault data is stored locally, encrypted with your master password.
- **Traditional ethos**: Simple, understandable, no-nonsense password management.

---

## Features

- Vault encryption using a master password.
- Password CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) management.
- Password strength meter and generator.
- LocalStorage-based encrypted vault.
- Import/export of encrypted vaults.
- Search functionality and usage statistics.
- Auto logout and clipboard clearing.

See `HOW_TO.md` for user instructions.

## Optional Browser Enhancements

If you intend to host this application or serve it in a browser context:

- You may include a `favicon.ico` or `<link rel="icon">` tag in the HTML head for a custom browser tab icon.
- These assets are entirely optional and do not affect functionality or security.
- Favicons may be stored in the same directory or linked via absolute or relative paths as needed.

---

## Usage

Open any version of the app in a modern browser by launching its `.html` file directly. No installation required.

---

## Security Considerations

- Never lose your master password — it cannot be recovered.
- Only open the application in secure environments you control.
- Always export your vault to an encrypted backup periodically.

## License

MIT License — see each version folder for a copy.

## Development and Contributions

This project is versioned manually and structured for conservative, offline use. Contributions are welcome if they maintain the project's core principles:

- No server-side components.
- No dependency on external libraries or services.
- Respect for user privacy and sovereignty.

---

## Maintainer Philosophy

This project is built with a traditional mindset: durability, simplicity, and self-sufficiency over trends or hype. If you're looking for a password manager that just works and puts you in control, this may suit your needs.
